## <p style="text-align: center;">Learning Java Core</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
This repository equips you to learn Java core concepts. Master Java syntax, data types, and control flow. But OOP is key: classes, 
objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. These principles create clean, maintainable code. Also dive deeper into files,
collections, enums, generics, streams, lambdas, functional interfaces, concurrency, networking, logging, debugging, unit testing,
and REST API development. We'll also cover servlets, Spring, and Hibernate. By mastering these concepts, you'll be equipped to tackle any
Java backend project

<br>

><p style="text-align: justify;">For well-rounded backend expertise, explore these additional skills:</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<b>Database:</b> Master relational databases (Oracle, MS SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) or NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra, GraphQL) for data persistence.<br>
<b>Messaging:</b> Learn RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka for asynchronous communication between services.<br>
<b>Testing:</b> Write unit and integration tests (JUnit) for robust code.<br>
<b>Cloud:</b> Explore platforms like AWS or Azure for deployment and scalability.<br>

JavaFX, the open-source Java library for building desktop and mobile applications, might seem like a relic compared to modern frameworks. But here's why it's worth a second look:

<b>Rich UI's:</b> Build beautiful, hardware-accelerated interfaces effortlessly. Animations, effects, and smooth interactions are a breeze.<br>
<b>Cross-Platform:</b> Run JavaFX apps flawlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux without platform-specific code.<br>
<b>Modern Development:</b> Design UIs visually with the JavaFX Scene Builder, streamlining your workflow.<br>

> <p style="text-align: justify;">Before we begin the course, there are a few prerequisites you need to set up on your local system.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">

1. `Java Software Development Kit (JDK)` is a collection of tools that helps us compile and build robust Java projects, enabling the creation of effective systems.
2. We need a build system to ensure unit tests are run and Java projects are bundled into their respective project artifacts (JAR/WAR), making them deployable to servers accessible through services over the internet.
Here are some common build systems:
   * `Maven` is a popular build automation tool used for managing project dependencies, building applications, and deploying them to various environments. It uses a declarative
approach, where developers specify what needs to be done in a configuration file (pom.xml).
   * `Gradle` is another widely used build automation tool that offers a more flexible approach compared to Maven. It uses a Groovy-based scripting language for defining build tasks and dependencies.
3. An `Integrated Development Environment (IDE)` helps identify compilation errors, maintain packages, compile code, create artifacts, and display execution results or errors on the console. It also enables debugging code and fixing issues very easily. Additionally, it provides different views to
aid your programming and improve productivity.
Here are some common IDE:
   * `IntelliJ IDEA` is a popular IDE from JetBrains that offers a wide range of features for Java development, including code completion, refactoring, debugging, and integration with various build tools
and testing frameworks. It has a free Community Edition and paid plans for additional features.
   * `Eclipse` is a mature open-source IDE that supports Java development and other programming languages. It offers a modular design with various plugins available for extending its functionality.
   * `NetBeans` is another free and open-source IDE for Java development, offering a user-friendly interface and support for various development tasks.
4. We need to ensure data should persist permanently. This will prevent data loss for our application. Maintaining data integrity is crucial. Here are some types of databases:
   * `RDBMS/SQL:` Oracle, MySQL, MS SQL, PostgresSql, Snowflake etc.
   * `No-SQL:` MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, GraphQL etc.
5. `(Optional)` In today's world, many teams are distributed or remote. This necessitates the use of centralized repositories that store the latest code for developers to share.  This allows anyone working on any module to collaborate by sharing code through a common repository, which ultimately improves team productivity.
Here are some of the common source code repositories:
   * `GitHub` is a popular version control system (VCS) that allows developers to track changes in code, collaborate on projects, and host code repositories.
It offers free public repositories and paid plans for private repositories with advanced features.
   * `GitLab` is another popular VCS platform that offers similar functionalities to GitHub, including public and private repositories, issue tracking, and project management tools.
   * `Bitbucket` is another Git-based repository hosting service often used by enterprises due to its focus on security and access control.

><p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Useful Tips:</b> <i>Before diving into code examples, skim the PDF to grasp the concepts. I've added the PDF in each respective module, which will help you understand the code much easier.Then, try running the code yourself. This hands-on approach reinforces understanding and prevents you from missing key logic. Remember to explore all code examples for their respective topics to build confidence in writing your own programs.</i></p>
